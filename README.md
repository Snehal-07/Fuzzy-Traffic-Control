• Traffic fuzzy control is a technique used to optimize traffic flow and reduce 
congestion in urban areas

• By applying fuzzy logic principles to traffic control systems, it is possible to 
create adaptive and responsive traffic management systems.

• Fuzzy logic-based traffic control systems offer a promising solution by 
incorporating human-like reasoning and decision-making processes into traffic 
management.

• Fuzzy logic algorithms are employed to interpret the imprecise and uncertain 
nature of traffic data, enabling the system to adjust traffic signal timings 
dynamically.
